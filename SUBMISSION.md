## Submission Options

### Option A: Add to the Monorepo (Preferred)

Submit a PR to add your plugin directly to this repository:

After approval, your plugin will be added to `plugins.json` and available in the Plugin Store.

### Option B: Keep Your Own Repository (3rd-Party)

If you prefer to maintain your own repo:

1. **Test Your Plugin**
   ```bash
   # Install via URL on your Pi
   curl -X POST http://your-pi:5000/api/plugins/install-from-url \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"repo_url": "https://github.com/you/ledmatrix-your-plugin"}'
   ```

2. **Open an Issue**
   Open an issue on this repository with your repo URL, description, and screenshots.

3. **After Review**
   We'll add a registry entry in `plugins.json` pointing to your repo.

## Review Process
